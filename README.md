### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Thank you for visiting my profile. My name is Jeff, and I am currently working as a QA Analyst while studying programming in my spare time. I have a strong passion for software testing, and I am planning to pursue a career as a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET), where I can combine my skills in both software development and testing.

Qoute I love : </br>
A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system. - John Gall

ðŸŒ± Things I am currently working towards in 2024... </br>
- [x] [C# Basic](https://centria.github.io/basic-csharp/) </br>
- [x] ISTQB Foundation Book ( not the cert ) </br>
- [ ] [C# Players Guide](https://csharpplayersguide.com/) </br>
- [ ] Living a balance life</br>

Something I enjoy ... </br>
My favorite aspect of my work is driving process improvements. I thrive when I encounter disorganized documentation, incomplete templates, or processes that can be streamlined to enhance efficiency and simplicity. There's nothing more satisfying than transforming a complex, convoluted process into something straightforward and easy to follow, making it so simple that even a child could understand and implement it.

#### Updates
- December 20, 2024 I have finished C# Basie this morning. I want to continue with this journey and keep improving. I would do the Advance MOOC on this course, but the TMC extention does not work. I have decided to pick up [C# Players Guide](https://csharpplayersguide.com/) to continue on this path. I have a broad understanding with the C# Basic and now I want to go a little deeper to understand what I learned in that course. I have read over the website for C# Players Guide a few times and the author mentions that this book will take a person 6-8 weeks. I am going to hedge that will of course take me longer and probably more like 6 months.

#### Books Read
- [X] Blood, sweat, and pixels : the triumphant, turbulent stories behind how video games are made by Schreier, Jason
  - This was a fun book to read and gave a look into the world of game development and how some games happened. I really enjoyed reading about Stardew Valley, but I think everyone really likes that story since that is what every game developer seems to want to do. I think it is wild that developers can spend a year or longer and not know if there game is "fun to play" up until the last few months before launch. I honestly don't know if I could handle that kind of stress in my life at a career. Also the fact that they will lay off when a game is launched then hire a few months later once they have an idea. That just seems really stupid to be honest. You think they would save more money, a run way perhaps, to keep from doing this trend.
- [X] The Phoenix projec By Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, George Spafford
  - The first four chapters of this book gave me such anxiety, that I was constatly getting up and telling my partnet what was happening. This was a great book to read and I am so happy I picked it up. The story that Bill and Parts Unlimited went through is not only stress inducing, but also knowledgable and fun. Some of my favorite parts is when he was meeting with Patty and Wes and they would be having discussions on how they are currently working and how they could improve it. I already used some of my Lean Six Sigma training from the Marines and the processes we used while working on AV8B aircraft in development, to improve processes at my place of employement and have gained significant improvements, but it is awesome to read about them from a book. I highly recommend this book to anyone, just because the first four chapters are again, anxiety riden and hard to stop reading.
