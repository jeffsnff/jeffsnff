### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Thanks for stopping by. As you can see from my profile, I am Jeff. I am currently a QA Analyst studying frontend development in my free time by going through [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) I really enjoy testing software, and I think I am going to do down the SDET path and combine software development with software testing. 

Qoute I love : </br>
A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system. - John Gall

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... </br>
Currently I am getting back into learning frontend development. I went to a coding bootcamp in the end of 2019, but with the lack of job offers, and losing motivation I took a break from it for while to just work in IT and get my life back in order. Now that I have found more resemblance of balance, I am going through Full Stack Open which has been both fun and refreshing.

Something I enjoy ... </br>
My favorite things to do at work are process improvements. My creative juices start to flow when I see a jumbled mess of documentation, templates, or lack there of, and processes that could be improved upon to increase workflow and simplicity. Turning a jumbled complex process that is hard to follow and implement is the best thing in the world to boil down and make simple so even a child can follow it.
